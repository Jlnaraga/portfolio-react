                    <p>Web design is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content online.

                    <h1 class="heading"> UI/UX <br /> DESIGN</h1>
                    <p>A UI, UX, and front-end web developer is responsible for applying interactive and visual design principles on websites and web applications for a positive and cohesive user experience. These developers use HTML, CSS, and other design tools to achieve responsive designs. UI, UX, and front-end developers are often assisted by back-end web developers, who are responsible for server-side application integration and logic.</p>
